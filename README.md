Share to Workplace by Facebook Bookmarklet

I created the Workplace bookmarlet to enable easy one button publishing of any web page from a web browser to Workplace. This will allow greater levels or particpation and adoption by making it rediculously easy to post new and engaging content to Workplace.

This is a raw javascript that enable the bookmarket shortcut to work. Create a new shortcut on the Bookmarks bar and copy and past the code from the share.js file in to the URL field. Give it a name like Share to Workplace and save.
